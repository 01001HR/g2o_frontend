    0.99999 -0.00450645    0.132308
 0.00450645     0.99999 0.000341909
          0           0           1
The next vertex has 57 edge.

***Extracting lines from CURRENT frame***
  !!! Merdging happened --> Using 25 line vertex already aligned
Saved lines previously merged.. size is: 25

***Extracting lines from NEXT frame***
Saved lines of the next vertex, size is:24

 ### iteration 14, SIZE of the pair of lines sets: 25, 24

###### edges from the current robot poses ######
This vertex has 54 edge.
- Odom edge from vertex  15 to 16
###Skipping this edge (forward evaluation of the odometry)###
- Odom edge from vertex  16 to 17
Odometry transformation between the current vertex 16 and the next one 17:
    0.999999   0.00112724     0.130319
 -0.00112724     0.999999 -0.000153427
           0            0            1
The next vertex has 56 edge.

***Extracting lines from CURRENT frame***
  !!! Merdging happened --> Using 23 line vertex already aligned
Saved lines previously merged.. size is: 23

***Extracting lines from NEXT frame***
Saved lines of the next vertex, size is:24

 ### iteration 16, SIZE of the pair of lines sets: 23, 24
