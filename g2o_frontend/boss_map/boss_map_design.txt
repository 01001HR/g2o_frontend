Boss Map
A structure that embeds the state of the front-end for ROVINA.
The basic idea is to represent the state as  a hierarchical factor graph,
that stores:
- variables
- factors (constraints)
- in case of aggregated data (e.g.) local maps, we store also the
  information necessary to regenerate the data (e.g. which images have been used to generate a particular reconstruction)


More in detail, the nodes of this map represent map entities, that can be
- Sensing Frames: an aggregate of one or more sensor data acquired
  at the same (or close) time instants.
  
  Each sensing frame can be contained in one or more high level local maps.

- Local maps, that are collections of sensing frames.
  A local map
  - has a transform (the gauge), with respect to which all the internal frames are expressed.
  - has one or more sensing frames
  - a list of relations, the input relations,
    that are the input of the alignment algorithms to extabilish
    the position of the sensing frames
  - a list of relations connecting the frames, that are the output
    of the local map
  - a list of pairwise relations connecting the gauge with each other sensing frame
  - (optionally) a singleton constraint anchoring the gauge to the global frame
  - (optionally) an intermediate representation of the aggregated sensor data

- Relations between nodes contain geometrical constraints between
  the connected sensing frames.
